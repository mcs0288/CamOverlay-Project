# CamOverlay-Project

I believe that i have finnished the necessary changes. Ive added the package.json and package-lock.json files. Ive rewrite the code to several logic functions including a main function, and changuse the API to take plain url instead of html.

The variables camera_ip, camera_port, camera_username, camera_pass, hcti_user, hcti_pass are harded coded in for deminstration and testing purposes assuming that these variables will be passes in from other functions or files
